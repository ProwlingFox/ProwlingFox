Scrape Jobsites -> Queue -> GPT Minify -> DB

DB Contains:
- Origional Site
- Job Description
- Job Company
- Job Title
- List of typed questions.

For Each Jobsite We are scraping we need a function to apply to it.

API to Get Job Listings from DB {reccomendation engine}
API to Apply for Job listings
API to Get/Set Userdata

API to confirm job is alive {
	Check's Our DB
	If our db hasn't checked w/ source of truth in X seconds checks source of truth
	Updates our db if source of truth changed.
}

SCRAPING
===================
Scraping should ideally be completely asynchronous
We need to force the jobsite to index all of it's jobs, that we don't allready have
Getting 98% of jobs from a site is okay
Need to avoid massive traffic/spam
Legality?


Pitch
=================
To Candidates: Job Recruiter allready use ai to reject you, lets fight back
To Recruiters: Unless you're employing {marketing people?} the candiates that are best at selling themselves arent't nessicarily the best candidates, so let's put everyone on equal footing and use AI to offer you a selection of ideal candidates.
